# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
**Document ID:** Athena_SRS_Functional-Requirements_v0.2.0  
**Project:** Athena: An Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework for Real-Time Program Management and Proactive Risk Mitigation  
**Date:** 2026-02-19  
**Version:** 0.2.0 (Minor - Comprehensive Requirements with Use Cases & Analysis)

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a complete description of the functional and non-functional requirements for Project Athena. It serves as the primary reference for the development team during system design, implementation, and testing phases. The document is intended for all stakeholders including the development team, project guide, and evaluation panel.

### 1.2 Scope
Project Athena is an Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework that provides real-time program management and proactive risk mitigation for enterprise environments. The system operates within a self-contained simulation environment (Project Universe) and demonstrates MNC-grade capabilities using privacy-first, locally-deployed infrastructure. The system:
- **Ingests** real-time project events via webhooks from a simulated enterprise environment
- **Stores** structured relationships in a Knowledge Graph and unstructured context in a Vector Store
- **Reasons** using a multi-agent LangGraph state machine powered by a local LLM
- **Alerts** stakeholders proactively when risks are detected, with human-in-the-loop approval
- **Logs** every agent decision in an auditable Action & Tracking Log (ATL)

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Athena is a self-contained system that does NOT integrate with any external production tools. Instead, it creates its own simulated enterprise environment (Project Universe) and then monitors that environment autonomously.

| FR-05.7 | The Executor node SHALL carry out approved actions and log them to the ATL | HIGH | Action completion and audit |
| FR-05.8 | The Agent SHALL NEVER generate responses from its training data alone; all factual claims MUST be backed by data retrieved from Neo4j or ChromaDB | HIGH | Zero hallucination requirement |
| FR-05.9 | If no relevant data is found, the Agent SHALL respond: "I don't have sufficient information to answer this query. No matching data found in [source]." | HIGH | Explicit failure over confabulation |

## 10. Acceptance Criteria Summary

| # | Criterion | Pass Condition |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | The system starts with a single `docker-compose up -d` command | All 7 services reach "healthy" status within 3 minutes |
| 2 | The simulator generates realistic enterprise data on startup | SQLite contains ≥ 200 tickets across ≥ 3 projects |
| 3 | Chaos events trigger webhook delivery to Athena | ≥ 99% of chaos events produce a received webhook |
| 4 | User can query program status via chat | System responds with cited, accurate answer in < 5 seconds |
| 5 | System detects blocked critical tickets proactively | Detection occurs within 60 seconds of blocking event |
| 6 | Agent never fabricates data | 100% of factual claims in responses are backed by Neo4j/ChromaDB data |
| 7 | Sensitive actions require human approval | No alert or escalation bypasses the Human Gate |
| 8 | Complete audit trail exists | Every agent action has a corresponding ATL entry |
| 9 | System works completely offline | Full demo runs without any internet connectivity |
| 10 | Dashboard displays real-time health | RAG indicators update within 30 seconds of state change |

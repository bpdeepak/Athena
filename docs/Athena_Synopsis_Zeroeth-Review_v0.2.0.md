Project Stream:  Artificial Intelligence & Multi-Agent Systems

Title of the Project: Athena: An Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework for Real-Time Program Management and Proactive Risk Mitigation

---

## Problem Statement

In large-scale software enterprises, a Program Management Office (PMO) oversees multiple projects running in parallel. Each project generates data across tools like Jira (tickets, sprints, bugs), Azure DevOps (pipelines, work items), and ServiceNow (incidents, changes). Today, the Program Manager must **manually** log into each of these tools, extract data, cross-reference it, and compile a unified status report.

**Quantified Pain Points:**
- Manual status report compilation consumes **~10 hours/week per Program Manager**
- Critical blockers (e.g., a ticket blocked for 3 days) are discovered **2-3 days late** on average because no one is monitoring all tools simultaneously
- **40% of status meetings** are wasted reconciling conflicting data from different sources (e.g., Jira says "In Progress" but the developer says "Blocked")
- Decision-making is **reactive** — leadership learns about risks only after they have already escalated

**The Core Problem:** There is no intelligent system that continuously watches all project data, understands the relationships between tasks, people, and risks, and **proactively alerts** the right stakeholders before issues escalate.

---

## Motivation (Why is this topic chosen?)

The rise of **Agentic AI** (2024-2026) has created a new category of AI systems that go beyond simple question-answering. Unlike chatbots that passively wait for user input, **AI Agents** can autonomously observe data, reason about it, and take actions. This project leverages this paradigm shift to build a system that does not just answer questions about project status — it **actively monitors, detects anomalies, and raises alerts on its own**.

This is fundamentally different from "using a pretrained model":
- A pretrained model takes input → produces output (passive)
- **Athena** continuously ingests real-time events → builds a knowledge graph of relationships → detects patterns → drafts alerts → waits for human approval → logs actions (active, autonomous, auditable)

## Objectives of the Project

### Objective 1: Design and Build a Custom Enterprise Simulator ("Project Universe") From Scratch

**What:** We are building a fully functional software system that simulates a real enterprise project management environment. This is NOT a dataset — it is a **live, running application** that generates realistic project events in real-time.

**Why:** As students, we cannot access real corporate data from Jira or Azure DevOps (it is confidential). Instead of using static CSV datasets, we build a **live simulator** that behaves exactly like a real enterprise — creating tickets, assigning developers, updating statuses, and generating realistic failures.

**How it works:**
1. **Mock Jira API** — We build a REST API using FastAPI (Python) that replicates the Jira REST API. It has endpoints to create/update/delete Tickets, Epics, Users, Sprints, and Bugs. Internally, it stores data in an SQLite database with properly designed tables (Users, Epics, Stories, Risks, Audit_Log).
2. **Chaos Engine** — A scheduled background process (using APScheduler) that **periodically injects realistic failures** into the simulator. For example: randomly marking a critical ticket as "Blocked", creating a dependency cycle between tasks, overloading a developer with too many critical assignments, or delaying a milestone past its deadline. This simulates the unpredictable nature of real enterprise environments.
3. **Webhook Dispatcher** — Whenever any data changes in the simulator (a ticket status changes, a new blocker is created), the system **automatically fires an HTTP POST webhook** to Athena with the change payload — exactly as real Jira Cloud does.

**What we code ourselves:**
- Complete FastAPI application with 15+ REST endpoints
- SQLite database schema with 6 tables and proper foreign key relationships
- Chaos Engine with configurable failure injection rules
- Webhook system that fires real HTTP events
- Synthetic data generator that creates realistic team structures, projects, and task hierarchies

### Objective 2: Build a Knowledge Graph + Vector Store Architecture (GraphRAG) for Data Synthesis

**What:** When Athena receives webhook events from the simulator, the raw data is processed and stored in **two complementary knowledge systems** that we design and implement:

**System A — Knowledge Graph (Neo4j):**
- We design a graph schema with 5 node types (User, Task, Risk, Milestone, Feature) and 6 relationship types (ASSIGNED_TO, BLOCKS, PART_OF, HAS_RISK, IMPACTS, OWNS)
- We write a **Graph Syncer** module (using py2neo library) that takes incoming webhook data and creates/updates nodes and edges in Neo4j
- We write **Cypher queries** to answer structural questions like: "Find all blocked critical tasks", "Which developers have more than 5 active tasks?", "What risks impact delayed milestones?"

**System B — Vector Store (ChromaDB):**
- We design a vector indexing pipeline that takes text descriptions of tickets, meeting notes, and risk reports and converts them into **numerical vector embeddings** using the Llama 3 model
- We write a **Vector Indexer** module that stores these embeddings in ChromaDB collections (ticket_context, meeting_notes)
- This enables **semantic search** — finding relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords

**Why two systems:** The Knowledge Graph captures **structured relationships** (Task A blocks Task B, Developer X is overloaded). The Vector Store captures **unstructured meaning** (a ticket description mentions "performance degradation"). By querying both and merging the results, the system achieves **grounded, relationship-aware responses** that a simple pretrained model cannot.

### Objective 3: Develop a Multi-Agent Reasoning System Using LangGraph

**What:** We build a system where **multiple specialized AI agents collaborate** through a defined workflow to process queries and events. This is NOT a single call to a pretrained model. It is a **state machine** we design with the following agents:

| Agent | Role | What It Does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Planner** | Analyze intent | Receives a query or event and determines what type of task it is (status query? risk alert? action item?) |
| **Researcher** | Gather data | Queries the Knowledge Graph (Cypher) and Vector Store (semantic search) to collect all relevant context |
| **Alerter** | Draft communications | When a risk is detected, drafts a stakeholder alert with severity, impact analysis, and recommended action |
| **Responder** | Format output | Combines gathered data into a structured response with citations to specific ticket IDs |
| **Human Gate** | Approval check | For sensitive actions (sending alerts, escalating risks), pauses and requires human approval before proceeding |
| **Executor** | Take action | After approval, executes the approved action and logs it to the Action & Tracking Log |

**What we code ourselves:**
- A LangGraph state machine (Python) that defines the nodes (agents), edges (transitions), and conditional routing logic
- Custom **tool functions** that each agent can invoke: `search_graph()`, `search_docs()`, `get_user_info()`, `draft_message()`, `log_action()`
- A **Semantic Router** module that classifies incoming queries and routes them to the right processing path
- State checkpointing logic so the system can resume from failures

**How this differs from "just using a pretrained model":**
- The LLM (Llama 3) is only ONE component — it provides language understanding and generation
- The **intelligence** comes from our custom-designed agent workflow, tool integrations, and knowledge graph queries
- The LLM never answers from its training data alone — it is **forced** to cite specific ticket IDs from the Knowledge Graph
- If the LLM cannot find relevant data in our knowledge stores, it says "I don't have this information" instead of hallucinating

### Objective 4: Deploy as a Privacy-First, Fully Offline System

**What:** The entire system runs on a single laptop with no internet connection required. We achieve this by:
- Using **Ollama** (open-source LLM server) to run Llama 3 8B **locally** instead of calling OpenAI/Claude APIs
- Running Neo4j, ChromaDB, and all services inside **Docker containers** orchestrated via Docker Compose
- No data ever leaves the local machine — demonstrating **air-gapped deployment** suitable for defense, healthcare, or finance sectors

### Objective 5: Build a Dashboard for Real-Time Visualization and Interaction

**What:** A web-based dashboard (Next.js) that serves as the user interface:
- **Chat Interface** — Users ask natural language questions ("What is the status of Project Alpha?") and receive grounded, cited responses
- **Health Dashboard** — Real-time RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status indicators for program health, milestone progress, and risk levels
- **God Mode Console** — A special demo panel that lets evaluators manually trigger chaos events (inject a blocker, overload a developer) and watch Athena detect and respond to them in real-time

## Who Uses This System? (Target Users)

| User Role | How They Use Athena | When They Use It | Example Query |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **PMO Leader / VP** | Get an executive summary of all programs | Start of every work day; before board meetings | "Give me a health summary of all active projects" |
| **Program Manager** | Monitor specific project risks and blockers | Continuously throughout the day; when preparing status reports | "Which tickets are blocking the March milestone?" |
| **Scrum Master** | Track team workload and sprint health | During sprint planning and daily standups | "Is any developer overloaded with critical tasks?" |
| **Stakeholder** | Understand project impact on their division | When assessing risk exposure | "What risks impact the payment feature?" |

---

## Concrete Use Case Walkthrough

**Scenario: A critical ticket gets blocked at 2:00 PM**

```
Step 1 (2:00 PM) — CHAOS ENGINE injects a blocker
   The Chaos Engine in Project Universe randomly marks TICKET-789 
   (priority: CRITICAL) as "Blocked by TICKET-456"

Step 2 (2:00 PM) — WEBHOOK FIRES
   The Simulator's Webhook Dispatcher sends an HTTP POST to Athena:
   { "event": "ticket_updated", "ticket_id": "TICKET-789", 
     "field": "status", "new_value": "BLOCKED", 
     "blocked_by": "TICKET-456" }

Step 3 (2:00 PM) — ATHENA INGESTS THE EVENT
   The Ingestion Pipeline receives the webhook, parses the JSON, 
   and triggers two updates:
   a) Graph Syncer creates a [:BLOCKS] relationship in Neo4j
   b) Vector Indexer updates the ticket embedding in ChromaDB

Step 4 (2:01 PM) — RISK AGENT DETECTS THE ANOMALY
   The LangGraph Planner node detects this is a risk event.
   Routes to the Researcher agent, which runs Cypher queries:
   - "What is the priority of TICKET-789?" → CRITICAL
   - "What milestone does TICKET-789 belong to?" → March Release
   - "Who is the owner of TICKET-456?" → developer@company.com
   - "Are there other tasks blocked downstream?" → 3 tasks found

Step 5 (2:01 PM) — ALERT DRAFTED
   The Alerter agent drafts a message:
   "⚠️ CRITICAL ALERT: TICKET-789 (Payment Integration) is now 
    BLOCKED by TICKET-456 (API Gateway Fix). This impacts the March 
    Release milestone. 3 downstream tasks are also affected. 
    Owner: developer@company.com. 
    Recommended action: Escalate to Engineering Lead.
    [Source: TICKET-789, EPIC-12, MILESTONE-3]"

Step 6 (2:01 PM) — HUMAN GATE
   The alert is held at the Human Gate node. The PMO is notified 
   in the Dashboard and can approve/modify/reject the alert.

Step 7 (2:02 PM) — LOGGED IN ATL
   Once approved, the action is logged in the Action & Tracking Log 
   with timestamp, agent ID, reasoning, and outcome.
```

**Total Time: ~60 seconds from event to alert. Versus 2-3 DAYS in manual monitoring.**

## Dataset: What Data Does This Project Use?

**This project does NOT use a static pre-existing dataset.** Instead, the data is **generated dynamically** by the Project Universe Simulator that we build:

| Data Type | How It Is Generated | Volume | Storage |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| **Users** | Synthetic data generator creates realistic team structures (developers, PMs, QA, VPs) with names, roles, emails | 20-50 users | SQLite |
| **Epics & Stories** | Generated to simulate a multi-project enterprise environment with 3-5 projects, each with 4-8 epics and 30-50 stories | 200+ tickets | SQLite → Neo4j |
| **Risks** | Created by Chaos Engine when anomalies are injected (blocked tasks, overdue milestones, overloaded developers) | Dynamic (grows over time) | SQLite → Neo4j |
| **Webhook Events** | Fired in real-time whenever any entity changes state in the simulator | 50-100 events/day | Athena Ingestion Pipeline |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Built incrementally by the Graph Syncer from ingested webhook events | 500+ nodes, 1000+ relationships | Neo4j |
| **Vector Embeddings** | Generated by passing ticket descriptions through Llama 3's embedding model | 200+ vectors (768 dimensions each) | ChromaDB |
| **Audit Trail** | Every agent decision and action is logged with timestamp and rationale | Grows continuously | SQLite (ATL) |

**Why this approach is more rigorous than using a static dataset:**
1. A static CSV file cannot test **real-time event processing** — our system processes live webhook events
2. A static dataset cannot test **anomaly detection** — our Chaos Engine creates unpredictable failures
3. A static dataset cannot demonstrate **temporal reasoning** — our system tracks how entities evolve over time
4. Our generated data structure mirrors real enterprise schemas, validating that the architecture works with production-grade data models

### User Input

This is a Major Project for my Engineering Degree. This project needs to be done in a manner that is worthy of being deployed as a product by a MNC Tech Company. I have given the information regarding the project in the file @[INITIAL.md] , it contains the objectives, requirements for the project.

@rules:Maintain Industry Standard SDLC Policies.

For now, Research the domain, complete all necessary phases before design and development.

### User Input

I have some issues regarding this. 
- This is a college project, we don't have access to Jira or ADO data for projects in a company, what are the feasible options in that scenario?
- LLM API costs for high-level models are high. Are there open-source or other options available?
- The main assumption in this project, is that we have a company's support in this. This is not true, we are a team of 4 students, developing this project. So we have to look for data, costs, dev, tests, plan, demo , etc.. by ourselves.

### User Input

Do not over simplify the project requirements, objectives, deliverables. We are students who are graduating and joining companies in months time, we know things will be difficult, that is the reason we chose this ambitious project. So do not remove diificult features that you assumed students can't do. My only problem was that we don't have the data and the money to staisfy the project's ambitious requirements.

### User Input

Before doing the implementation, I need to complete some documentation tasks to be finished. So please create some detailed docs from the information gathered till now. Use ASCI Text Formatting for diagram in the files. Follow the rules mentioned in the @[docs/Athena_Documentation_Rules.md]

### Planner Response

Here's the PPT content structured exactly per your required slides:

---

### **Slide 1: Problem Statement**

- Manual program status reporting consumes ~10 hours/week per Program Manager
- Critical blockers are discovered 2-3 days late on average
- 40% of status meetings are spent reconciling conflicting data from multiple sources
- No unified "Single Source of Truth" exists across project management tools
- Reactive decision-making causes issues to escalate before PMO awareness

---

### **Slide 2: Objective & Scope of the Proposed Project**

**Objectives:**
1. Build a Multi-Agent System (LangGraph) for real-time program monitoring
2. Implement GraphRAG architecture (Neo4j + ChromaDB) for unified data synthesis
3. Develop a High-Fidelity Enterprise Simulator ("Project Universe")
4. Create human-in-the-loop approval workflows for risk communication
5. Deploy a privacy-first solution using local LLMs (Ollama + Llama 3)

**Scope:**
- Simulated enterprise data integration via webhooks
- Autonomous risk detection and severity categorization
- Natural language query interface for program status
- Action & Tracking Log (ATL) for audit compliance
- Dashboard visualization of program health

---

### **Slide 3: Proposed Methodology**

**Model:** Agile-Incremental (2-week sprints)

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Research & Planning | Weeks 1-2 | Domain research, feasibility, SRS |
| System Design | Weeks 3-4 | HLD, database schema, API contracts |
| Development | Weeks 5-8 | Simulator, agent core, dashboard |
| Testing & Verification | Weeks 9-12 | Integration tests, demo, documentation |

---

### **Slide 4: Hardware & Software to be used**

**Software (Development):**

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Languages | Python 3.11, TypeScript |
| Frameworks | FastAPI, LangGraph, Next.js 14 |
| Databases | SQLite, Neo4j CE, ChromaDB |
| AI Runtime | Ollama, Llama 3 (8B) |
| DevOps | Docker, Docker Compose, Git |

**Hardware (Deployment):**

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| RAM | Minimum 16 GB |
| Storage | 50 GB |
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 3060+ (recommended) |

---

### **Slide 5: Expected Outcome of the Proposed Project**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Query Response Time | < 5 seconds |
| Risk Detection Latency | < 60 seconds |
| Data Accuracy | Zero hallucination (citation-based) |
| Offline Capability | 100% functional |
| Blocker Identification | 95% detection rate |
| Audit Trail | Complete decision logging |

---

### **Slide 6: What contribution to society would the project make?**

- **Efficiency:** Frees 10+ hours/week per PM from manual data aggregation
- **Proactive Safety:** Early risk identification prevents project failures
- **Data-Driven Culture:** Real-time accurate information for all stakeholders
- **Privacy-First AI:** Enterprise AI without cloud data leakage
- **Open-Source Education:** Architecture patterns for AI agent development
- **Knowledge Democratization:** Reduces information gap between teams and leadership
